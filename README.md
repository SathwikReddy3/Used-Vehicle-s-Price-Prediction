# Used-Vehicle-s-Price-Prediction
**Abstract**

Accurately predicting the price of used vehicles is a critical task for both buyers and sellers, facilitating informed decision-making and fair market practices. This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning model to predict the prices of used vehicles based on key features such as make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and condition. By leveraging advanced data science techniques, this study aims to enhance transparency and efficiency in the used vehicle market.

The project begins with the collection and preprocessing of data. The dataset includes diverse attributes that influence vehicle pricing. Data preprocessing involves cleaning missing values, normalizing numeric fields, and encoding categorical variables to ensure compatibility with machine learning algorithms. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to identify trends, correlations, and outliers, providing valuable insights into the dataset’s structure.

Two machine learning algorithms, Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor, are employed to build predictive models. Linear Regression offers interpretability and establishes a baseline for performance, while Random Forest’s ensemble approach captures complex patterns in the data for improved accuracy. The models are evaluated using metrics such as the R² score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), ensuring reliable assessment of their predictive power.

The results demonstrate that the Random Forest model outperforms Linear Regression, achieving a higher R² score and lower MAE. Visualizations such as feature importance graphs and actual vs. predicted price plots provide a deeper understanding of model behavior and key determinants of vehicle prices.

This project contributes to the domain of predictive analytics by providing a practical solution for used vehicle price estimation. The model’s implementation can be extended to online platforms, enabling users to estimate fair prices conveniently. Future enhancements include incorporating additional features like location and market demand trends to further improve prediction accuracy. The complete project, including data preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and results, is hosted on GitHub for transparency and collaboration.
